										<h1>The Responsibilities of a Real Estate Attorney</h1>
										
									</header>
									<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are considering purchasing or have already started the process of purchasing a home, it is imperative that you work with a real estate attorney to help with the closing date. A real estate attorney can address almost all of your concerns throughout the closing procedure and ensure you get the property you want without any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we discuss the various responsibilities of a real estate attorney during a real estate purchase or sale.</span></p>
<h2>Why Hire a Real Estate Attorney?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might believe that you can skip this step to minimize your outlay, but getting accurate advice from a real estate attorney is a must if you are a first-time homebuyer. The services as well as steps required to present a </span><strong>final real estate agreement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are typically viewed as "the practice of law," so they are done by an attorney licensed to practice law in your location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers are often necessary for the completion of a real estate transaction. You should have arranged a real estate attorney early in the procedure to make sure you were obtaining the aid you require.</span></p>
<h2>Preparation of Legal Documentation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be </span><a href="https://www.vidhikarya.com/legal-blog/What-and-how-Property-Lawyers-do-their-job"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helpful to speak with a real estate attorney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when purchasing a home. For example, your attorney may draft the sales contract between you, the buyer, and the seller, draw up the deed to the property, and review the agreement with your lender.</span></p>

<h3>Title Search</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate lawyer performs a title search to identify any encumbrances on the building. Deeds of trust, judgments, past-due taxes, and claims on or liens against the property can slow down the process of transferring title and cause problems down the road. Your real estate attorney will work to help you find any discrepancies in the title that might </span><a href="http://www.financialized.com/Mortgages/real-estate-lawyers-expertise-responsibilities"><span style="font-weight: 400;">help resolve your ownership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the property in case a problem is discovered. Your attorney has a </span><strong>professional responsibility</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help identify and resolve any issues that could prevent the transfer of property to your name.</span></p>
<h3>Closing Facilitation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the lender approves the title binder, the physical copies of all the loan documents are delivered to the closing company for settlement. A real estate attorney will facilitate the closing of the loan and the transfer of ownership to the buyer. The closing will be attended by the parties who were involved in the purchase or sale. Afterward, they will meet at an attorney's office, where he or she will go over each document, </span><strong>clearly explaining each's significance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the participants are interpreting it. Since neither party must be there at any given time, chances are good that they can leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney will begin by providing the closing statement (an ALTA settlement statement or HUD-1), which will guarantee the correctness of the settlement costs and credits and accurately list out all items of the settlement, with the loan servicer. Afterwards, the attorney will </span><a href="https://www.vidhikarya.com/legal-blog/What-and-how-Property-Lawyers-do-their-job"><span style="font-weight: 400;">review the deed documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in full, with the customer, to ensure all precise property information is recorded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney will facilitate the closing by sending copies of the loan documentation to the financial institution. He will sign the deed and deed of trust at the Register of Deeds office, transfer the proceeds, make payments (such as commissions to all parties involved in the transaction and lender fees), and set up escrow accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In summary, Reading real estate contracts and real estate documents is the main task for a </span><a href="https://james.net.au/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property buyers advocate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also have to oversee real estate closings, get involved in loan issues, and provide </span><strong>advice on legal issues relating to real estate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, they are responsible for real estate litigation and mediation, and they draft and review real estate documents including deeds, mortgages, and leases.</span></p>
